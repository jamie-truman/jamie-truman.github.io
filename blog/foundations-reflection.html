        <div>
          <h2>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</h2>
          <p>During the core learning ive learned that i can do alot more than i think i can, on some occasions i thought to myself "you cant do it" but with time and effort i managed to complete the work. Another thing that ive learned is that i have the tendancy to procrastinate all my work. Lastly i feel i need to be more open to getting help as im still learning and not knowing everything is ok</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h2>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h2>
          <p>I think that values and self-awareness play a big part in learning and programming because they help us understand our feelings. For example if were feeling stresses we can better understand why we are feeling this way and make a change. It also helps us be aware of other peoples feelings and being able to understand what they are going through so you can better help them also. </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h2>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h2>
          <p>Ive learned alot about myself and alot about what i can do to better myself by just simple lifestyle changes. For example, Not going on my phone as soon as i wake up as im about to look at a screen all day and instead go outside for a minute.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h2>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h2>
          <p>Just learning that i have alot to learn about myself as ive never really taken anytime to think about the mental side of myself.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h2>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</h2>
          <p>I feel that staring at a screen and being isolated can take a toll on a person mentally and physicaly, I also think that as the bootcamp is aparently quite intensive it can take a toll on your mental health. I think that if we are aware of what is causing us to feel sad/angry/frustrated we can better help ourselves solve those issues.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h2>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</h2>
          <p>No i dont think it was a waste of time as ive learned quite alot about myself. I think that this time we spent core learning will help us excell our programming skills and help us learn more efficiently.</p>
