      <h2>Identity and Values</h2>
      <p id="para">My values are present in my everyday life and I choose to live by them everyday. Some of my key values are Fairness, Kindness, Loyalty, Generosity. I took the Institute of character quiz to see if these values I said previously lined up with what I got. The quiz came back saying that some of my key values are Fairness, Humor, Kindness, Judgement and forgiveness. I think that these are accurate and even though they are not my key values they do very much apply to me.</p>
      <div>
        <h2>Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.</h2>
        <p>When I was a kid around the age of 9-10 me and my friend would go to the dairy after school to get lollies and whatever as most kids our age did. Because we were kids we didn't always have money to spend on lollies so when I went up to buy my lollies from the dairy my friend would slip a bag or two of lollies in his pocket and walk out with me. Now at the time I didn't realise he did this but as we walked out he told me. Now I had two options in this situation, One was to go back and tell the dairy owner what had happened and give them back or, Two keep walking away like nothing happened. Now as an easily impressionable kid I obviously just kept walking away like nothing happened. Looking back on it I think that at that moment I made the wrong call. Because of that moment where my friend got away with it once he continued with this behavior for a while after. Maybe if I had gone back and told on him he might have stoped.</p>

      <div id="para">
        <h2>Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity.</h2>
        <p>My parents and grandparents are my biggest role models. Ever since I was a kid they have always taught me to be kind to others and always treat everyone with respect which I have kept with me. My parents and grandparents are the nicest people I know and I think have been a very positive influence on me.  My friend group at the moment are also very positive influences on me, always trying to get me out of my comfort zone. </p>
      </div>
      <div id="para">
        <h2>Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey.</h2>
        <p>I feel that if I put my mind to anything I can achieve it. There is nothing holding me back from achieving my goals except for me.  My strengths will support me during my learning because even if I get stuck or are unsure of what to do, I believe I can persevere and overcome whatever obstacle is in my way.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="para">
        <h2>Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development. How might these affect your learning journey?</h2>
        <p>In my opinion my biggest limitation is my motivation to get things done. I really struggle with finding the energy to start getting my work done or get up and go to the gym. But I'd like to think that I'm working on this everyday. I also feel that I might be a bit shy at times and introverted but I'm working on it.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="para">
        <h2>Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.</h2>
        <p>During my studies at Weltec last year one of the first projects I had to do was a group project with a couple other members in my class. We had about a week of time to get it done to present. I emailed both of my group members everyday that week asking for a time to set up a call or even just asked if they had started working on it yet. But no response so on the last day i had to finish the project myself and present it. I think looking back on it i should have asked my teacher sooner what i should have done instead of waiting till the last day. </p>
