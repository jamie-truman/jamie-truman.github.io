        <h2>The DOM</h2>
        <div>
          <p>Java script, HTML and css are used for front and back end development. HTML and CSS are used to make your website look nice with colors and fonts for everything. While java script on the other hand is used to make everything on your website work, for example you could have a button on your website that gives you a random number. The button and the text is made using HTML and the color of the button, the font of the text is all done using CSS. And lastly how the button actually gives you a random number is done using java script. Think of javascript, html and css like a box, html is the wood that makes up the shape of the box, css is the paint or the oil to make your box look good and javascript is the hinge of the box to make it open and close. </p>
        </div>

          <p>The workflow of Javascript goes from the top of the page to the bottom, unless there is a loop or conditional. Imagine workflow and loops like making a car go. You can get in the car, put your seatbelt on, put the key in the ignition, take the car out of park, put the handbrake down. But because you didnt turn the key to turn the car on you now have to go back and do it again.

          <p>The DOM is what tells the program what language you are using and what model to use. Say you are programming in html you can write all the code which might work but if you don't identify the DOM VS code won't understand what language you are using and won't have a structure set up. You can interact with the DOM by using its functions, for example you could use the “document.createElement” to create a new element on your html page. There are many of the functions ranging from making new elements to getting the element id of an object.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>In javascript you can use objects and arrays to store values and add keys to these values. You would use an object if your value can be defined by multiple characteristics and you would use an array if you had a list of values and wanted them to be defined by a place in the list. If you wanted to access data from an object you would call the objects names and what characteristic you used as the key to get it rather than in an array where you would call the position in the list of values to get the data.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>Functions allow you to define a block of code which is used by defining the function keyword. Functions are useful because you are able to define the block of code and then run it multiple times using the function key. You can insert data that is already defined into the function or you could insert data that is given dynamically. </p>
