    <h2>EQ And IQ</h1>
    
    <p>
      Emotional Intelligence is the ability to interpret people's emotions and relate to them constructively. There are 4 main areas surrounding EQ(Emotional Intelligence) which are, Perceiving emotions, Reasoning with emotions, Understanding emotions and Managing emotions. These 4 components used together can help you accurately understand what people are feeling and how you can help. EQ has been used alot more in recent years to improve health and well-being, Also to prevent bullying. Another large part of EQ is being able to empathize with other people and how they are feeling.

    <p>
      The main two differences between IQ(Intelligence Quotient) and EQ(Emotional Quotient) is that IQ is your ability to learn and understand information rather than EQ which is to identify and understand others and your own emotions. EQ and IQ are very different in the sense that you can be very smart but be lacking emotional control or being able to identify your emotions. This can cause you to not work well in teams as if a team member is getting angry at you and you're not sure why it can affect your efficiency.

    <p>
      EQ is important because if you are not able to identify others and your own emotions it can affect you negatively. For example people who have low EQâ€™s don't work well in teams as they are not able to identify emotions and empathize with team members if something goes wrong. If you are not able to identify your own emotions, it can lead to you being unmotivated, stressed and just generally feeling sad or angry.
