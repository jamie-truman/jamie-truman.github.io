        <h2>Neuroplasticity</h2>
        <div>  
          <p>When people understand what neuroplasticity is it benefits them because they realize that they are able to do anything if you push yourself and practice. When people become aware of how neuroplasticity works they change their attitude towards learning because before they thought their skills and talents were fixed. Because of recent studies we are now aware that there are many factors in learning something other than studying. For example one of the principles of neuroplasticity is repetition. Repetition matters because if you donâ€™t repeat the task your brain will slowly lose and forget how to do it.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>There are many principles of neuroplasticity which are to name a few, Use it or lose it, Specificity, Repetition, Intensity and a few more. For you to use these principles together you need to commit yourself to learning by using the principles. For example if you want to learn the guitar you would need to practice every day consistently because if you stop you will start forgetting how to. If you wanted to specifically learn a song even though you might only know that song on the guitar because you now know how to play all those strings it will transfer over to other songs that use the same which is the transference principle.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>For you to increase your neuroplasticity you will need to practice everyday constantly and at ranging levels of intensity because change can help. I think the main thing to keep in mind while trying to increase your neuroplasticity is to just be consistent because as soon as you stop your brain will start forgetting. </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>Growth mindset is the knowledge that hard work and time can help you become smarter and achieve bigger things. Kids who are rewarded for putting hard work and time into a project are contributing to a growth mindset whereas kids who are told they are doing a good job without putting in the time promotes a fixed mindset. Studies have shown that people who have a growth mindset are working hard and because of this are achieving bigger things.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>I think personally before this research I myself had a fixed mindset because i'm told sometimes that I'm doing a good job when really I might be hardly working. These comments for me reinforced my fixed mindset and encouraged me to keep hardly working and taking the easy way out of things. I would really like to start working harder and putting more time in and hopefully my work will show this.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>Im am going to start working harder on projects and try to stop taking the easy way out because it encourages my fixed mindset. I realized while researching that i do have a fixed mindset whereas before i didn't and i would like to change that. </p>
