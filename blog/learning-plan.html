      <div id="para">
        <h2>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h2>
        <p>Long term I would really like to start working as soon as I can as I think that at the moment having work experience is the best way to find a job. I would love to get into the tech industry early as I think it's going to be very relevant in the near future.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="para">
        <h2>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h2>
        <p>I would like to think if I put my mind to something I can achieve anything which would be my greatest strength at the moment. My biggest weakness/Limitation at the moment is I struggle to find motivation to get things done and I am really good at procrastinating. </p>
      </div>
      <div id="para">
        <h2>What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h2>
        <p>I would really like to work on my work ethic. At the moment I think it's very lacking and I sometimes try to find easy ways out of things instead of just doing the work. My dad has one of the best work ethics I've seen and I would love to follow in his footsteps</p>
      </div>
      <div id="para">
        <h2>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme</h2>
        <p>I think for myself personally I find I work really well when I have a strict schedule to go by. When the boot camp starts I hope I will excel during that time as 8:45 to 5:30 everyday will be really good for me. I hope I can manage my workload properly and not let work build up but if it does I'm not afraid to ask for help as I don't know everything and that's why I'm here. </p>
      </div>
      <div id="para">
        <h2>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h2>
        <p>If I ever need help I know there are plenty of ways I can ask for help such as asking in the Discord or emailing the facilitators. I have already asked for help a number of times and I always get a response very quickly which I am very appreciative of.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="para">
        <h2>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h2>
        <p>All i would expect from the facilitation team is that if i ever needed help i would help that they would be able to assist me in anything course related. </p>
      </div>
      <div id="para">
        <h2>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whƒÅnau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</h2>
        <p>I am currently not employed and I don't have any commitments at the moment as I'm living with my parents. My parents are very supportive and are aware that this course will be taking up all of my time and have told me that they are there if i need anything.</p>
      </div>


      <h2>Revised Learning Plan</h2>

      <p>My long term goal for the course would be to be able to get a foot in the door in the tech industry, I belive that the tech industry is the future. I belive that my strengths for the bootcamp will be able to ask for help if i get stuck on something or i am unsure of what to do. But my weaknesses will be that i struggle to find the motivation to get the work done sometimes, this is somthing ive been working on and plan to keep working on it. I feel that i will work well in groups as im a pretty social guy online, i do get a bit of stage fright but i would like to work on that also during the bootcamp. All i would ask from the bootcamp team would be to be able to be easily reached if i ever get stuck. I am going to really push myself throughout this bootcamp and try and break any boundries ive set on myself and by the end of it i hope im going to come out a better version of me. </p>
