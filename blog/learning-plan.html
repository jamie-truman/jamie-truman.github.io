        <h2>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h2>
        <p>Long term I would really like to start working as soon as I can as I think that at the moment having work experience is the best way to find a job. I would love to get into the tech industry early as I think it's going to be very relevant in the near future.</p>

        <h2>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h2>
        <p>I would like to think if I put my mind to something I can achieve anything which would be my greatest strength at the moment. My biggest weakness/Limitation at the moment is I struggle to find motivation to get things done and I am really good at procrastinating. </p>

      <div id="para">
        <h2>What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h2>
        <p>I would really like to work on my work ethic. At the moment I think it's very lacking and I sometimes try to find easy ways out of things instead of just doing the work. My dad has one of the best work ethics I've seen and I would love to follow in his footsteps</p>

      <div id="para">
        <h2>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme</h2>
        <p>I think for myself personally I find I work really well when I have a strict schedule to go by. When the boot camp starts I hope I will excel during that time as 8:45 to 5:30 everyday will be really good for me. I hope I can manage my workload properly and not let work build up but if it does I'm not afraid to ask for help as I don't know everything and that's why I'm here. </p>
      </div>
      <div id="para">
        <h2>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h2>
        <p>If I ever need help I know there are plenty of ways I can ask for help such as asking in the Discord or emailing the facilitators. I have already asked for help a number of times and I always get a response very quickly which I am very appreciative of.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="para">
        <h2>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h2>
        <p>All i would expect from the facilitation team is that if i ever needed help i would help that they would be able to assist me in anything course related. </p>
      </div>
      <div id="para">
        <h2>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whƒÅnau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</h2>
        <p>I am currently not employed and I don't have any commitments at the moment as I'm living with my parents. My parents are very supportive and are aware that this course will be taking up all of my time and have told me that they are there if i need anything.</p>
